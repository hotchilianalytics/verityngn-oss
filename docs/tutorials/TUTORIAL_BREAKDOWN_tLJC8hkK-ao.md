## 💡 Tutorial Insights

### 1. The "Exclusivity" Trap
The video repeatedly uses the word "Exclusive" and "Secret." VerityNgn identified these as high-relevance markers for promotional deceptive content.

### 2. The Credibility Gap
While the video *looks* like a CNN or BBC interview, Stage 2 verification revealed that none of the "facts" cited (Time Magazine, World Obesity Atlas) were represented accurately.

### 3. Multimodal Excellence
The system successfully captured claims from both the fast-paced interview and the static text overlays appearing on screen, ensuring a comprehensive debunking.
