# LinkedIn Announcement Post

## Post Content (Copy/paste this)

---

Every minute, 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube.

Fact-checkers can review maybe 10-20 claims per day.

The math doesn't work. And it's about to get worse.

Today I'm open-sourcing **VerityNgn** — an AI-powered system that generates truthfulness reports for YouTube videos.

But here's what makes it different from existing fact-checking tools:

**1. It analyzes the FULL video** — not just the transcript. Visual demonstrations, on-screen graphics, audio cues. The multimodal reality of video misinformation.

**2. It uses counter-intelligence** — actively searching for contradictory evidence. YouTube reviews from independent creators. Press release detection that identifies promotional content masquerading as news.

**3. It gives you probabilities, not pronouncements** — a calibrated TRUE/FALSE/UNCERTAIN distribution. Because real-world claims are rarely simply "true" or "false."

---

**The results:**
- 75% accuracy vs. ground truth (95% CI: 61-85%)
- +18% improvement from counter-intel on misleading content
- Well-calibrated (Brier score = 0.12)
- $0.50-2.00 per video

I built this because I believe misinformation is too important a problem to solve behind closed doors.

The methodology needs to be transparent. The code needs to be auditable. The community needs to be able to improve it.

Looking forward to your feedback — and contributions.

## Formatting Notes for LinkedIn

- Use the "---" as visual paragraph breaks (LinkedIn supports this)
- Emojis are optional — this version is clean/professional
- The hashtags go at the very end
- Consider adding a relevant image (screenshot of a report)

## Alternative Opening Hooks (Pick One)

**Option A (used above):**
"Every minute, 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube..."

**Option B (problem-first):**
"Video misinformation spreads faster than fact-checkers can keep up. I built something to help."

**Option C (announcement-first):**
"I'm thrilled to announce the open-source release of VerityNgn — an AI that fact-checks YouTube videos."

**Option D (personal story):**
"A year ago, I watched someone I care about fall for a health scam video. Today, I'm releasing what I built in response."
