# I Built an AI That Fact-Checks YouTube Videos — Here's What I Learned About Fighting Misinformation

*Video misinformation is growing faster than fact-checkers can keep up. So I built an open-source system that fights back — with counter-intelligence.* 1

### The Problem No One Is Solving

Every minute, 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube. That's 720,000 hours per day 1\. Meanwhile, professional fact-checkers can review maybe 10-20 claims per day — if they're working full-time 1\.  
The math doesn't work 3\.  
But here's what really bothers me: **existing automated fact-checking tools only analyze text** 3\. They read the transcript and call it a day, missing the on-screen graphics claiming "clinically proven" or visual demonstrations that look convincing but are meaningless 3\. Video misinformation is fundamentally different from text misinformation because it combines multiple modalities — spoken words, visuals, on-screen text, audio cues — into a persuasive package that bypasses our critical thinking 3\.  
And there's another problem: **search engines are broken for fact-checking** 4\. When you Google claims from a scam supplement video, you often find promotional press releases designed to look like news 4\. The search results *confirm* the false claims because the misinformation ecosystem is optimized for SEO 4\.

### Building VerityNgn: A Counter-Intelligence Approach

I spent the last year building **VerityNgn** (Verity Engine) — an open-source system that takes a fundamentally different approach to video verification 6\. The core insight is that we need counter-intelligence, not just fact-checking 6\.

#### 1\. Multimodal Analysis — Not Just Text

VerityNgn uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash to analyze the *full video* at 1 frame per second, processing spoken words, on-screen text (OCR), visual demonstrations, and audio cues 6\. The 1M token context window means we can process up to 47 minutes of video in a single pass without losing context 6\.

#### 2\. Counter-Intelligence — Actively Seeking Contradictory Evidence

This is the key innovation 8\. Instead of just searching for evidence that confirms or denies claims, VerityNgn actively hunts for:

* **YouTube review videos:** Independent creators who have reviewed, tested, or debunked the content 8\.  
* **Press release detection:** Identifies promotional content masquerading as news with 94% precision 8\.  
* **Contradiction weighting:** Evidence that contradicts the claim is weighted more heavily than confirming evidence 8\.

Why? Because misinformation is designed to generate supporting evidence 8\. Counter-intelligence cuts through this by explicitly searching for opposition 8\.

#### 3\. Probabilistic Truthfulness — Not Binary Verdicts

Real-world claims are rarely simply "true" or "false" 9\. VerityNgn generates a three-state probability distribution: **TRUE** (evidence supports), **FALSE** (evidence contradicts), and **UNCERTAIN** (insufficient or conflicting evidence) 9\.  
CRAAP Analysis Report*The system performs a deep credibility analysis, scoring content on Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose. (Source: CRAAP Analysis 10\)*  
We report calibrated probabilities, not confident-sounding guesses 11\. A claim might be TRUE for some people, FALSE as a general claim, and UNCERTAIN given specific evidence 9\.

### The Results

We evaluated VerityNgn on claims spanning health supplements, financial advice, cryptocurrency, and misinformation videos 11\.  
Accuracy Statistics*VerityNgn achieves 75% accuracy against ground truth, with a significant boost from its counter-intelligence module. (Source: Stats Graphic 12\)*  
Metric,Result  
Accuracy vs. ground truth,75% (95% CI: 61-85%) 13  
Improvement from counter-intel,+18% on misleading content 13  
Calibration (Brier score),0.12 13  
Precision (FALSE claims),85% 13  
The counter-intelligence system adds 18 percentage points of accuracy on misleading content (scam videos, conspiracy theories) 13\. That's the difference between a usable system and a toy 13\.

### See It In Action

The output is an interactive HTML report showing each claim extracted from the video, evidence found for and against, and specific recommendations for the viewer 11, 14\.

You can review specific recommendations generated by the AI based on the evidence found:

### Try It Right Now

The easiest way to try VerityNgn is the live Streamlit app 16:  
[**verityngn.streamlit.app**](https://verityngn.streamlit.app)

1. Paste a YouTube URL 16\.  
2. Click "Start Verification" 16\.  
3. Browse the Gallery to see your report 16\.

App Input Screen*The main interface allows for direct video URL input or channel selection. (Source: App Screenshot 17\)*

### Open Source: Apache 2.0

The entire codebase is open source under Apache 2.0 16\. You can find it here:  
[**github.com/hotchilianalytics/verityngn-oss**](https://github.com/hotchilianalytics/verityngn-oss)  
This includes the complete verification engine, Streamlit UI, three methodology papers with full transparency, Docker deployment configurations, and API documentation 16\.  
I'm releasing this because I believe misinformation is too important a problem to solve behind closed doors 18\. The methodology needs to be transparent, the code needs to be auditable, and the community needs to be able to improve it 18\.

### Limitations (Honest Assessment)

VerityNgn is a research project, not a production fact-checking service 18\. The 75% accuracy means 25% of claims are incorrectly assessed 19\. It is currently English-only, works only on YouTube, and while it has a 94% precision in detecting press releases, it is still susceptible to coordinated campaigns if enough fake "review" videos exist 8, 18\.  
This is a tool to augment human judgment, not replace it 19\.

### What's Next

We are currently prioritizing multi-language support (Spanish, French, German), additional platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels, and expanded evidence sources such as Reddit and specialized databases 19\.  
If you're interested in misinformation research, AI, or just want to see how this works, please **star the repo** and try the demo 20\. The fight against misinformation needs all of us 20\.
