# ✅ Progress Logging Added

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Segment Logging in `analysis.py`

Added comprehensive progress logging at lines 4065-4093:

**Before:**
```python
# Silent processing - no logs for segment 0
texts.append(call_segment(start, end))
```

**After:**
```python
# Calculate total segments upfront
total_segments = max(1, (duration_sec + SEGMENT_DURATION_SECONDS - 1) // SEGMENT_DURATION_SECONDS)

# Show segmentation plan
logger.info(f"🎬 [VERTEX] Segmentation plan: {duration_sec}s video → {total_segments} segment(s)")
logger.info(f"   Expected time: ~{total_segments * 8}-{total_segments * 12} minutes total")

# Log EVERY segment (including segment 0!)
logger.info(f"🎬 [VERTEX] Segment {segment_count + 1}/{total_segments}: Processing {start}s → {end}s")
logger.info(f"   ⏱️  Expected processing time: 8-12 minutes for this segment")
logger.info(f"   📊 Progress: {((segment_count) / total_segments * 100):.0f}% complete")
logger.info(f"   ⏳ Please wait... (this is NORMAL, not hung)")

texts.append(call_segment(start, end))
```

### 2. Updated `.env` with Shorter Segments

Added to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Segment duration for video analysis (300s = 5 minutes per segment)
SEGMENT_DURATION_SECONDS=300
```

**Impact:**
- 33-minute video = **7 segments** (instead of 1)
- Progress update every 8-12 minutes (instead of silence for 30+ minutes)
- Same total time, but with feedback

## What You'll See Now

### Old Behavior (Silent)
```
✅ Video metadata extracted...
[30+ minutes of silence]
✅ Initial analysis completed
```

### New Behavior (With Progress)
```
✅ Video metadata extracted...

🎬 [VERTEX] Segmentation plan: 1998s video → 7 segment(s) of 300s each
   Expected time: ~56-84 minutes total

🎬 [VERTEX] Segment 1/7: Processing 0s → 300s (5.0 minutes)
   ⏱️  Expected processing time: 8-12 minutes for this segment
   📊 Progress: 0% complete
   ⏳ Please wait... (this is NORMAL, not hung)

[wait 8-12 minutes]

[VERTEX] segment=(0,300) finish=STOP usage=... len=3297

🎬 [VERTEX] Segment 2/7: Processing 300s → 600s (5.0 minutes)
   ⏱️  Expected processing time: 8-12 minutes for this segment
   📊 Progress: 14% complete
   ⏳ Please wait... (this is NORMAL, not hung)

[wait 8-12 minutes]

[VERTEX] segment=(300,600) finish=STOP usage=... len=2841

... continues for all 7 segments ...

✅ Initial analysis completed
```

## Expected Runtime

| Video Length | Segments (@ 300s) | Expected Time |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 5 minutes | 1 | 8-12 min |
| 10 minutes | 2 | 16-24 min |
| 20 minutes | 4 | 32-48 min |
| 33 minutes (tL video) | 7 | **56-84 min** |
| 60 minutes | 12 | 96-144 min |

## Benefits

✅ **Clear progress feedback** - No more wondering if it's hung  
✅ **Time estimates** - Know how long to wait  
✅ **Progress percentage** - See advancement  
✅ **Segment completion logs** - Confirm each segment finishes  

## Run Test Now

```bash
python test_tl_video.py
```

You'll now see progress updates every 8-12 minutes instead of 30+ minutes of silence.

## If You Want Faster Feedback

Trade-off: More API calls, but more frequent updates

```bash
# 2-minute segments = updates every 5-8 minutes
echo "SEGMENT_DURATION_SECONDS=120" >> .env

# 10-minute segments = updates every 10-15 minutes  
echo "SEGMENT_DURATION_SECONDS=600" >> .env
```

**Recommended:** Stick with 300s (5 min) for good balance of:
- API efficiency (fewer calls)
- Progress feedback (every 8-12 min)
- Reliability (smaller chunks easier to retry on error)
