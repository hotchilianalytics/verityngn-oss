# ‚úÖ Test Run Success - tLJC8hkK-ao (LIPOZEM)

## Test Execution Summary

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Video ID:** tLJC8hkK-ao  
**Video Title:** [LIPOZEM] Exclusive Interview with Dr. Julian Ross  
**Runtime:** ~9 minutes  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFUL**

---

## Setup Steps Completed

1. ‚úÖ Verified `.env` file exists with credentials
2. ‚úÖ Fixed `psutil` import to be optional (for development environments)
3. ‚úÖ Installed missing dependencies (`psutil`, `isodate`)
4. ‚úÖ Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable explicitly
5. ‚úÖ Ran `test_tl_video.py` successfully

---

## Workflow Stages Completed

1. ‚úÖ **Video Download** - Downloaded via yt-dlp (YouTube API fallback worked)
2. ‚úÖ **Initial Analysis** - Multimodal analysis with Gemini (with some rate limiting)
3. ‚úÖ **Counter-Intelligence** - YouTube search (limited due to API config)
4. ‚úÖ **Claim Extraction** - Extracted 2 claims from video
5. ‚úÖ **Claim Verification** - Verified claims (limited web search due to API config)
6. ‚úÖ **Report Generation** - Generated JSON, Markdown, and HTML reports
7. ‚úÖ **Save Reports** - Reports saved to timestamped directory

---

## Results

### Verification Verdict

**Overall Assessment:** "Likely to be False"

### Key Findings

1. **Unsubstantiated Health Claims**
   - Video makes extraordinary health claims about turmeric for weight loss
   - No scientific evidence or peer-reviewed research to support claims

2. **Lack of Verifiable Specifics**
   - Content lacks specific, verifiable claims
   - Vagueness suggests intentional lack of transparency

3. **Implausible Promises**
   - Claims rapid fat loss (15 lbs in 4 weeks from turmeric alone)
   - Exaggerated promises without credible scientific basis

### Truthfulness Metrics

- **False/Likely False Claims:** 100%
- **True/Likely True Claims:** 0%
- **Claims Processed:** 2

## Observations & Notes

### What Worked Well ‚úÖ

1. Video download via yt-dlp worked perfectly as YouTube API fallback
2. Multimodal analysis with Vertex AI Gemini succeeded
3. Claim extraction identified key misleading claims
4. Report generation produced all three formats (JSON, MD, HTML)
5. Timestamped storage organized outputs properly

### Known Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **YouTube API Not Fully Configured**
   - System fell back to yt-dlp successfully
   - Counter-intelligence YouTube search had limited results

2. **Google Search API Not Fully Configured**
   - Web search for claim verification was limited
   - Evidence gathering was constrained

3. **Vertex AI Rate Limiting**
   - Hit 429 errors (resource exhausted) during analysis
   - System handled gracefully with retries

4. **JSON Parsing Warnings**
   - Some Gemini responses had malformed JSON
   - Parser recovered successfully

### To Improve Results üéØ

For better verification results, ensure these are set in `.env`:

```bash
# YouTube Data API (for metadata and counter-intelligence)
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=AIza...

# Google Custom Search (for web evidence gathering)
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=AIza...
GOOGLE_CSE_ID=your-search-engine-id
```

## How to Run Again

### Quick Run

```bash
cd /Users/ajjc/proj/verityngn-oss
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/Users/ajjc/proj/verityngn-oss/verityngn/config/verityindex-0-0-1-6a21e94ca0a3.json"
python test_tl_video.py
```

### With Different Video

Edit `test_tl_video.py` and change:

```python
video_id = "your_video_id"
video_url = f"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={video_id}"
```

## Viewing Results

### HTML Report (Recommended)

```bash
open verityngn/outputs/tLJC8hkK-ao/2025-10-27_22-39-29_complete/tLJC8hkK-ao_report.html
```

### JSON Report

```bash
cat verityngn/outputs/tLJC8hkK-ao/2025-10-27_22-39-29_complete/tLJC8hkK-ao_report.json | jq .
```

### Markdown Report

```bash
cat verityngn/outputs/tLJC8hkK-ao/2025-10-27_22-39-29_complete/tLJC8hkK-ao_report.md
```

## Troubleshooting Reference

### Issue: "No module named 'psutil'"

**Solution:** Already fixed! Made `psutil` optional in `verityngn/workflows/analysis.py`

```python
try:
    import psutil
except ImportError:
    psutil = None
```

### Issue: "No module named 'isodate'"

**Solution:** Already installed! 

```bash
pip install isodate psutil
```

### Issue: OAuth2 RefreshError

**Solution:** Explicitly set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account.json"
```

### Issue: YouTube API errors

**Solution:** System falls back to yt-dlp automatically (works without API key)

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Test script created and working**
2. ‚úÖ **Dependencies fixed for OSS release**
3. ‚úÖ **Credentials via .env file working**
4. üéØ **Consider adding YOUTUBE_API_KEY and GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY to .env for full functionality**

---

## Summary

The VerityNgn verification workflow is **working successfully** and can:

- ‚úÖ Download and analyze YouTube videos
- ‚úÖ Extract claims using multimodal LLM
- ‚úÖ Verify claims with available evidence
- ‚úÖ Generate comprehensive truthfulness reports
- ‚úÖ Handle API fallbacks gracefully
- ‚úÖ Work without full API configuration (with limitations)

The test demonstrates that the system can successfully identify misleading health claims and provide a clear verdict on video truthfulness.

**Test Status: ‚úÖ PASSED**
