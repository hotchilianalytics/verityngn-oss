```

### Technology Stack

- **Multimodal LLM:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (via Vertex AI)
- **Context Window:** 64K tokens for comprehensive analysis
- **Video Processing:** yt-dlp for video download and metadata
- **Web Search:** Google Custom Search API
- **Framework:** LangGraph for workflow orchestration
- **Storage:** Local filesystem or Google Cloud Storage

---

## 2. Multimodal Analysis Pipeline

### Video Processing Strategy

VerityNgn uses an **aggressive frame-sampling approach**:

```python
SAMPLING_RATE = 1 FPS  # 1 frame per second
TARGET_CLAIMS = 3 per minute of video
CONTEXT_WINDOW = 64K tokens (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
```

### Frame-by-Frame Analysis

For each frame, the system analyzes:

1. **Visual Content:**
   - On-screen text and graphics
   - Demonstrations and visual evidence
   - Charts, graphs, and data visualizations
   - Product displays or examples

2. **Audio Track:**
   - Spoken statements with timestamps
   - Speaker identification
   - Tone and delivery analysis

3. **Metadata:**
   - Video title and description
   - Channel information
   - Upload date and view count
   - Comments and engagement metrics

### CRAAP Criteria Integration

All claims are evaluated using the CRAAP framework:

- **Currency:** When was the information published?
- **Relevance:** Is it relevant to the video's main message?
- **Authority:** What credentials or expertise is claimed?
- **Accuracy:** Can it be verified with external sources?
- **Purpose:** Is it promotional, educational, or persuasive?

### Prompt Engineering

The system uses carefully crafted prompts to ensure high-quality claim extraction:

```
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR MULTIMODAL VIDEO ANALYSIS:
- Analyze this video with MAXIMUM detail at 1 FRAME PER SECOND sampling rate
- Extract ALL factual claims, statements, assertions from ACTUAL VIDEO CONTENT
- Focus on SPOKEN WORDS, VISUAL TEXT, ON-SCREEN GRAPHICS, and DEMONSTRATIONS
- Ignore background music, decorative elements, or irrelevant visuals
- Extract EXACTLY 5-15 specific, verifiable claims
```

**Claim Mix Requirements:**
- 70% Scientific & Verifiable Claims (studies, statistics, product effectiveness)
- 10% Speaker Credibility Claims (credentials, affiliations, experience)
- 20% Other Verifiable Claims (dates, locations, specific statements)

### Output Format

Claims are extracted in structured JSON:

```json
{
  "claim_text": "Dr. X has 20 years of experience in endocrinology",
  "timestamp": "02:15",
  "speaker": "Dr. X (Narrator)",
  "source_type": "spoken",
  "initial_assessment": "Verifiable credential claim requiring external verification"
}
```

---

## 3. Claims Extraction Methodology

### Claim Quality Criteria

Each extracted claim must meet these requirements:

1. **Specificity:** Concrete, not vague or general
2. **Verifiability:** Can be checked against external sources
3. **Relevance:** Central to the video's message
4. **Factuality:** Stated as fact, not opinion
5. **Significance:** Meaningful for truthfulness assessment

### Claim Types

**Primary Claims (70%):**
- Study results: "Study X found Y outcome"
- Statistics: "75% of patients experienced Z"
- Product effectiveness: "Product causes W in N days"
- Scientific findings: "Research shows..."

**Secondary Claims (10%):**
- Educational credentials: "Dr. X studied at Y"
- Professional experience: "X years in field"
- Institutional affiliations: "Works at Hospital Y"
- Awards and recognitions

**Other Claims (20%):**
- Historical facts
- Geographic information
- Temporal data
- Specific events or occurrences

### Anti-Patterns (Avoided)

The system explicitly avoids:
- Vague motivational statements
- General health advice without specifics
- Obvious facts not requiring verification
- Micro-claims too granular for meaningful assessment
- Subjective opinions without factual basis

---

## 4. Counter-Intelligence System

### Overview

VerityNgn's counter-intelligence system is designed to detect and weight **contradictory evidence** that challenges claims made in the analyzed video. This is one of the system's most innovative features.

### Two-Pronged Approach

#### A. Press Release Detection

**Purpose:** Identify self-promotional content that lacks independent validation.

**Detection Method:**
```python
PRESS_RELEASE_INDICATORS = [
    'prnewswire.com', 'businesswire.com', 'globenewswire.com',
    'prnewswire', 'marketwired', 'accesswire', 'prweb.com',
    'press release', 'newswire', 'press statement'
]
```

**Bias Application:**
- **Probability Adjustment:** -0.4 (significant negative bias)
- **Rationale:** Press releases are promotional, not independent verification
- **Distribution Impact:**
  - Reduce TRUE by 60% of adjustment
  - Increase FALSE by 40% of adjustment
  - Increase UNCERTAIN by 40% of adjustment

**Example:**
```
Claim: "Product X causes 15 pounds of weight loss"
Evidence: 5 press releases from product manufacturer

Result: TRUE probability reduced by 24% (0.4 * 0.6)
        FALSE probability increased by 16% (0.4 * 0.4)
        UNCERTAIN increased by 16% (0.4 * 0.4)
```

#### B. YouTube Counter-Intelligence

**Purpose:** Find and analyze review videos that contradict claims in the original video.

**Search Strategy:**
```python
COUNTER_INTEL_QUERIES = [
    "{video_title} scam review",
    "{video_title} fake exposed",
    "{video_title} debunk analysis",
    "{main_keywords} + warning review",
    "{product_name} doesn't work"
]
```

**Transcript Analysis:**

The system analyzes transcripts of review videos for:

1. **Counter-Signals:**
   - 'scam', 'fake', 'fraud', 'lie', 'misleading'
   - 'doesn\'t work', 'waste of money', 'no results'
   - 'red flags', 'warning', 'beware', 'avoid'
   - 'overpriced', 'overhyped', 'disappointing'
   - 'fabricated', 'deceptive', 'predatory', 'exposed'

2. **Supporting Signals:**
   - 'works', 'effective', 'results', 'recommend'
   - 'good', 'helps', 'success', 'positive'
   - 'beneficial', 'worth it', 'legit'

**Stance Determination:**
```python
counter_ratio = counter_signals / (counter_signals + supporting_signals)

if counter_ratio > 0.7:
    stance = 'counter'
    confidence = min(0.95, 0.6 + (counter_ratio - 0.7) * 1.17)
elif counter_ratio < 0.3:
    stance = 'supporting'
    confidence = min(0.95, 0.6 + (0.3 - counter_ratio) * 1.17)
else:
    stance = 'neutral'
    confidence = 0.5
```

**Credibility Weighting:**

Counter-intelligence evidence is weighted by:
- **View Count:** Videos with 100K+ views = stronger signal
- **Channel Credibility:** Established channels weighted higher
- **Video Age:** Recent videos weighted higher
- **Engagement:** Like ratio and comment sentiment

**Probability Impact:**

YouTube counter-intelligence has **reduced** impact compared to earlier versions:

```python
# Enhanced (balanced) approach:
youtube_impact = min(0.20, youtube_counter_power * 0.08)
enhanced_dist["FALSE"] = min(0.85, base_false + youtube_impact)

# Reduction rationale: Avoid over-aggressive FALSE bias
# Previous: max 0.35 impact, max 0.9 FALSE
# Current: max 0.20 impact, max 0.85 FALSE
```

### Counter-Intelligence in Action

**Example Case:**

```
Original Video: "Amazing weight loss supplement - lose 15 pounds!"

Counter-Intelligence Found:
1. "Product X Scam Exposed" (450K views) - Counter stance (90% confidence)
2. "I Tried Product X - My Honest Review" (120K views) - Counter stance (85% confidence)
3. "Product X Doesn't Work - Warning" (75K views) - Counter stance (80% confidence)

Impact:
- Base FALSE probability: 30%
- YouTube CI adjustment: +12% (0.12 based on reach and confidence)
- Final FALSE probability: 42%
```

---

## 5. Probability Distribution Model

### Three-State Model

VerityNgn uses a probabilistic approach rather than binary true/false:

```
P(TRUE) + P(FALSE) + P(UNCERTAIN) = 1.0
```

### Base Probability Initialization

```python
base_dist = {
    "TRUE": 0.3,      # Starting assumption: neutral
    "FALSE": 0.3,      # Equal weight to false
    "UNCERTAIN": 0.4   # Highest initial uncertainty
}
```

### Enhancement Factors

The base distribution is adjusted based on five key factors:

#### Factor 1: Evidence Coverage (10-30% boost)

```python
coverage_score = evidence_count / (claim_word_count / 5)
if coverage_score > 1.0:
    boost = min(0.3, coverage_score * 0.15)
    enhanced_dist["TRUE"] += boost
```

**Rationale:** More evidence per claim indicates stronger validation.

#### Factor 2: Independent Source Ratio (10-25% boost)

```python
independent_ratio = independent_sources / total_sources
if independent_ratio > 0.5:
    boost = min(0.25, (independent_ratio - 0.5) * 0.5)
    enhanced_dist["TRUE"] += boost
```

**Rationale:** Independent sources provide unbiased validation.

#### Factor 3: Scientific Evidence (up to 40% boost)

```python
science_weight = min(0.4, scientific_power * 0.2)
enhanced_dist["TRUE"] += science_weight
```

**Rationale:** Scientific sources (journals, academic institutions) carry highest weight.

#### Factor 4: YouTube Counter-Intelligence (-20% impact)

```python
youtube_impact = min(0.20, youtube_counter_power * 0.08)
enhanced_dist["FALSE"] += youtube_impact
```

**Rationale:** Contradictory reviews reduce claim trustworthiness.

#### Factor 5: Press Release Penalty (-40% impact)

```python
self_ref_count = count_self_referential_sources()
penalty = min(0.4, self_ref_count * 0.15)
enhanced_dist["FALSE"] += penalty
```

**Rationale:** Self-promotional content is inherently biased.

### Normalization

After all adjustments, probabilities are normalized:

```python
total = sum(enhanced_dist.values())
if total > 0:
    enhanced_dist = {k: v / total for k, v in enhanced_dist.items()}

# Ensure minimum thresholds
for key in ["TRUE", "FALSE", "UNCERTAIN"]:
    enhanced_dist[key] = max(0.001, enhanced_dist[key])
```

### Verdict Mapping

The continuous probabilities are mapped to human-readable verdicts:

```python
TRUE% = P(TRUE) * 100
FALSE% = P(FALSE) * 100
UNCERTAIN% = P(UNCERTAIN) * 100

if TRUE > 70 and FALSE < 10:
    verdict = "HIGHLY_LIKELY_TRUE"
elif (TRUE + UNCERTAIN) > 65 and FALSE < 35:
    verdict = "LIKELY_TRUE"
elif TRUE > 40 and FALSE < 35:
    verdict = "LEANING_TRUE"
elif abs(TRUE - FALSE) < 10:
    verdict = "UNCERTAIN"
elif FALSE > 35 and TRUE < 30:
    verdict = "LEANING_FALSE"
elif (FALSE + UNCERTAIN) > 65 and TRUE < 35:
    verdict = "LIKELY_FALSE"
elif FALSE > 75:
    verdict = "HIGHLY_LIKELY_FALSE"
```

**Rationale for Thresholds:**
- 65% threshold for "likely" verdicts (relaxed from 70% to avoid over-conservatism)
- 70% threshold for "highly likely" verdicts
- Combination with UNCERTAIN allows for nuanced assessment

## 6. Evidence Classification & Weighting

### Source Categories

Evidence is classified into six categories, each with distinct validation power:

#### 1. Scientific Sources (Highest Weight: 2.5-4.0)

**Characteristics:**
- Peer-reviewed journals
- Academic institutions (.edu domains)
- Research papers and studies
- Government research agencies

**Examples:**
- PubMed/NCBI publications
- Journal articles (Nature, Science, NEJM)
- University research papers
- NIH/CDC reports

**Validation Power:** 2.5 - 4.0 (highest)

#### 2. Independent Sources (High Weight: 1.5-2.0)

**Characteristics:**
- Reputable news organizations
- Fact-checking organizations
- Independent analysis
- No financial stake in outcome

**Examples:**
- Reuters, AP News, BBC
- FactCheck.org, Snopes, PolitiFact
- Independent medical websites (Mayo Clinic, WebMD)

**Validation Power:** 1.5 - 2.0

#### 3. Government Sources (High Weight: 1.5-2.5)

**Characteristics:**
- .gov domains
- Official government publications
- Regulatory agency reports

**Examples:**
- FDA reports
- CDC guidelines
- NIH publications
- FTC consumer alerts

**Validation Power:** 1.5 - 2.5

#### 4. Press Releases (Negative Weight: -0.5 to -1.0)

**Characteristics:**
- Self-promotional content
- Newswire services
- Company press statements
- Marketing materials

**Examples:**
- PR Newswire articles
- Business Wire releases
- Company blog posts
- Marketing pages

**Validation Power:** -0.5 to -1.0 (penalized)

#### 5. YouTube Counter-Intelligence (Variable: 0.5-2.0)

**Characteristics:**
- Review videos
- Debunking content
- Investigation videos
- Consumer experiences

**Weight Determined By:**
- View count (100K+ = higher weight)
- Channel credibility
- Stance confidence
- Counter-signal strength

**Validation Power:** 0.5 - 2.0 (variable)

#### 6. Other Web Sources (Standard Weight: 1.0)

**Characteristics:**
- General web pages
- Blogs
- Forums
- Social media

**Validation Power:** 1.0 (baseline)

### Self-Referential Detection

The system identifies "self-referential" sources that cite the original video or its creators:

```python
def is_self_referential(source_url, source_text, video_title, video_channel):
    # Check if source cites the original video
    if video_title.lower() in source_text.lower():
        return True
    if video_channel.lower() in source_text.lower():
        return True
    if source_url contains video_domain:
        return True
    return False
```

Self-referential sources are:
- Separated into `press_releases` category
- Given negative validation power
- Excluded from supporting evidence counts

---

## 7. Verification Algorithm

### Claim Verification Process

For each extracted claim, the system follows this process:

```
1. Generate search queries
   ├─ Fact-check queries: "{claim} fact check"
   ├─ Scientific queries: "{claim} study research"
   ├─ General queries: exact claim text
   └─ Debunk queries: "{claim} debunk false"

2. Execute web searches
   ├─ Google Custom Search API
   ├─ Retrieve top 10 results per query
   └─ Extract URL, title, snippet

3. Classify evidence
   ├─ Identify source category
   ├─ Assign validation power
   ├─ Detect self-referential content
   └─ Determine supporting vs contradicting

4. Calculate probability distribution
   ├─ Start with base distribution
   ├─ Apply evidence boosts
   ├─ Apply counter-intelligence penalties
   ├─ Normalize to sum = 1.0
   └─ Map to verdict category

5. Generate explanation
   ├─ Summarize evidence
   ├─ Explain probability factors
   ├─ Cite key sources
   └─ Provide confidence assessment
```

### Multi-Factor Probability Calculation

The complete algorithm:

```python
def calculate_enhanced_probability_distribution(
    base_dist: Dict[str, float],
    evidence_groups: Dict[str, List[Dict]]
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, float], List[str]]:
    
    enhanced_dist = base_dist.copy()
    modifications = []
    
    # Extract evidence by category
    scientific_evidence = evidence_groups["scientific"]
    independent_evidence = evidence_groups["independent"]
    press_releases = evidence_groups["press_releases"]
    youtube_counter = evidence_groups["youtube_reviews"]
    
    # Calculate validation powers
    scientific_power = sum(e['validation_power'] for e in scientific_evidence)
    independent_power = sum(e['validation_power'] for e in independent_evidence)
    youtube_counter_power = sum(e['validation_power'] for e in youtube_counter)
    
    # Factor 1: Evidence coverage
    total_evidence = len(scientific_evidence) + len(independent_evidence)
    claim_length = len(claim_text.split())
    coverage_score = total_evidence / (claim_length / 5)
    
    if coverage_score > 1.0:
        coverage_boost = min(0.3, coverage_score * 0.15)
        enhanced_dist["TRUE"] += coverage_boost
        modifications.append(f"Evidence coverage boost: +{coverage_boost:.2f}")
    
    # Factor 2: Independent source ratio
    if independent_power > 0:
        independent_ratio = independent_power / (independent_power + scientific_power + 0.01)
        if independent_ratio > 0.5:
            indie_boost = min(0.25, (independent_ratio - 0.5) * 0.5)
            enhanced_dist["TRUE"] += indie_boost
            modifications.append(f"Independent sources boost: +{indie_boost:.2f}")
    
    # Factor 3: Scientific evidence weighting
    if scientific_power > 0:
        science_weight = min(0.4, scientific_power * 0.2)
        enhanced_dist["TRUE"] += science_weight
        modifications.append(f"Scientific evidence boost: +{science_weight:.2f}")
    
    # Factor 4: YouTube counter-intelligence
    if youtube_counter_power > 0:
        youtube_impact = min(0.20, youtube_counter_power * 0.08)
        enhanced_dist["FALSE"] += youtube_impact
        modifications.append(f"YouTube CI penalty: +{youtube_impact:.2f} to FALSE")
    
    # Factor 5: Press release penalty
    self_ref_count = len([pr for pr in press_releases if pr.get('self_referential')])
    if self_ref_count > 0:
        penalty = min(0.4, self_ref_count * 0.15)
        enhanced_dist["FALSE"] += penalty
        modifications.append(f"Press release penalty: +{penalty:.2f} to FALSE")
    
    # Normalize
    total = sum(enhanced_dist.values())
    enhanced_dist = {k: v / total for k, v in enhanced_dist.items()}
    
    # Ensure minimums
    for key in ["TRUE", "FALSE", "UNCERTAIN"]:
        enhanced_dist[key] = max(0.001, enhanced_dist[key])
    
    return enhanced_dist, modifications
```

[INDEPENDENT_COUNT] independent). 

[COUNTER_INTEL_STATEMENT if applicable]

Key supporting evidence: [TOP_SOURCES]

Probability: TRUE: X%, FALSE: Y%, UNCERTAIN: Z%
```

**Example:**
```
LIKELY FALSE based on 8 sources (1 scientific, 3 independent). 

YOUTUBE COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE: Multiple review videos (450K+ views) contradict 
this claim, providing independent contradictory perspective.

Press release sources have reduced validation power due to self-promotional nature.

Key supporting evidence: [1] National Institutes of Health study shows no 
significant effect [2] Mayo Clinic states insufficient evidence.

Probability: TRUE: 15%, FALSE: 70%, UNCERTAIN: 15%
```
