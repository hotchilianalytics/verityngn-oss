# The Mathematics of Misinformation

Every minute, 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube. That’s **720,000 hours per day**. Meanwhile, professional fact-checkers can review maybe 10-20 claims per day. The math simply doesn’t work.

Traditional automated tools only analyze text, missing on-screen graphics, visual demonstrations, and "white coat" authority signals. **VerityNgn** (Verity Engine) is an open-source system that doesn't just read transcripts—it watches, listens, and verifies the truth.

## What is VerityNgn?

VerityNgn is a multimodal analysis engine designed to fact-check video content at scale. It moves beyond simple RAG pipelines to provide a comprehensive verification suite:

- 🎥 **Multimodal Analysis**: Sampling at 1 FPS to capture OCR, visual context, and audio nuances.
- 🔍 **Evidence Verification**: Cross-referencing claims with scientific databases and credible web sources.
- 🕵️ **Counter-Intelligence**: Actively hunting for contradictory reviews and promotional press releases.
- 📊 **Probabilistic Assessment**: Delivering nuanced verdicts based on Bayesian aggregation of evidence.

## Why Open Source?

Misinformation is too big a problem to solve behind closed doors. We’ve released VerityNgn under the **Apache 2.0 license** to ensure the methodology is transparent, the code is auditable, and the community can contribute to a more truthful internet.
