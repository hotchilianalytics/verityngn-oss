- [x] **reporting.py** (1,454 lines) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê FULL PRODUCTION
  - Complete production `final_report.py`
  - JSON, Markdown, HTML report generators
  - Truthfulness score calculation
  - Evidence compilation and formatting
  - Pub/Sub notification support (for batch mode)
  - GCS upload with timestamped storage
  - Local file saving
  - Complete metadata tracking
  - **Battle-tested with 1,454 lines of production code**

- [x] **pipeline.py** (317 lines) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê FULL PRODUCTION
  - Complete production `main_workflow.py`
  - LangGraph workflow orchestration
  - Includes inline `run_counter_intel_once` function
  - Clean state management with TypedDict
  - Local-first execution
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - **Exact production implementation**

- [x] **counter_intel.py** (256 lines)
  - Extracted inline function for better organization
  - YouTube counter-intelligence search
  - Deep web search with LLM-driven queries
  - Channel expansion for topic-related videos
  - Topic term extraction
  - Semantic filtering

**Total Workflow Code:** 7,413 lines of FULL PRODUCTION QUALITY CODE

### üîç Sherlock Mode Analysis - What Was Preserved:

**CRITICAL RESTORATION PERFORMED:**
- ‚úÖ `analysis.py`: Restored from 535 ‚Üí 3,654 lines (+3,119 lines of battle-tested logic)
- ‚úÖ `verification.py`: Restored from 293 ‚Üí 1,732 lines (+1,439 lines of sophisticated verification)
- ‚úÖ `reporting.py`: Restored from 599 ‚Üí 1,454 lines (+855 lines of production features)
- ‚úÖ `pipeline.py`: Restored from 257 ‚Üí 317 lines (+60 lines with inline counter-intel)

**Total Preserved:** 5,473 lines of battle-tested production code that would have been lost!

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1 completion)
1. ‚úÖ Extract core workflow files - COMPLETE (all 5 files at full production quality)
2. üöß Copy services layer (video, report, search, storage) - IN PROGRESS
3. üöß Copy models layer (workflow, report)
4. üöß Adapt config layer (settings, prompts, auth)

### Phase 2: Multi-Auth & Configuration
1. Create `config/auth.py` with multi-auth support
2. Create `config.yaml.example` template
3. Implement settings loader with YAML support

### Phase 3: LLM Transparency Logging
1. Create `llm_logging/logger.py` with full capture
2. Integrate logging into all workflow LLM calls
3. Add structured output format for research

### Phase 4: Streamlit UI
1. Create main Streamlit app with tabs
2. Implement gallery browser
3. Add real-time progress tracking

### Phase 5: Documentation (3-tier academic papers)
1. Extended system documentation (30+ pages)
2. Full arXiv research paper (15-25 pages)
3. Brief technical report (5-10 pages)

## Execution Strategy

**Primary: Local-First** ‚≠ê
- Default execution on user's machine
- CLI: `verityngn verify <youtube_url>`
- Streamlit UI: `streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py`
- No cloud account required

**Optional: Google Batch**
- For processing many videos at scale
- Requires GCP project setup
- Documented in advanced guides

**Demo: Streamlit Community Cloud**
- Public demo with pre-populated gallery
- Process short videos (<5 min)

**Tutorial: Google Colab**
- Jupyter notebook walkthrough
- Free GPU access

## Key Design Decisions

1. **NO Simplification**: All production code preserved with full battle-tested logic
2. **Clean Separation**: Zero Cloud Run/Firestore/Pub/Sub dependencies (to be removed)
3. **Local-First**: Works immediately after `pip install verityngn`
4. **Multi-Auth**: Support service account, ADC, workload identity
5. **Full Transparency**: Log all LLM requests/responses for research
6. **Researcher-Friendly**: Step-by-step guides, not just API docs
7. **Community-Driven**: Gallery with user submissions and moderation
