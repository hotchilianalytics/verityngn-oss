# Sherlock Mode

When asked to use "Sherlock Mode", follow this exact sequence:
1. **Reflect**: List 5-7 different possible sources of the problem or categories for the search.
2. **Distill**: Narrow these down to the 2-3 most likely sources or most promising directions.
3. **Investigate**: Follow the code path (for debugging) or research path (for discovery) to verify if these sources are valid.
4. **Analysis**: Deeply reflect on findings and produce a comprehensive analysis of the issue or the results.
5. **Suggestions**: Suggest additional logs (for debugging) or next steps/validation steps.
6. **Cleanup**: Once a fix is implemented, ask for approval to remove any temporary diagnostic code or logs.
