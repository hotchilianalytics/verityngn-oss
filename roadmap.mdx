# Roadmap

Our mission is to build the foundational infrastructure for automated video verification. Here is what we are working on next.

## SourceWatch Initiative
SourceWatch will provide source credibility intelligence to VerityNgn through three integrated capabilities:

1. **Channel Credibility Scoring**: A comprehensive database of YouTube channel credibility scores based on historical accuracy and transparency.
2. **Suspect Video Discovery**: Automated detection systems to flag potentially misleading content before it goes viral.
3. **Truthful Sources Library**: A curated, high-validation-power library of authoritative sources for specialized fields (medicine, finance, climate).

## Platform Expansion
While we currently focus on YouTube, misinformation knows no boundaries. We are planning support for:
- [ ] **TikTok**: Short-form vertical video analysis.
- [ ] **Instagram Reels**: Cross-platform verification.
- [ ] **X (Twitter) Video**: Real-time verification for breaking news.
- [ ] **Facebook Video**: Broadening the impact on social platforms.

## Technical Enhancements
- **Adaptive FPS**: Dynamically adjusting frame sampling rates based on visual complexity (e.g., higher FPS during data demonstrations).
- **Multi-Model Support**: Seamlessly switching between Gemini, Claude, and GPT-4 for cross-model verification.
- **Explainable UI**: Interactive visualizations of the Bayesian aggregation process to help users understand *why* a verdict was reached.

## Community Priorities
We welcome contributions in the following areas:
- **Ground Truth Labeling**: Helping us expand our 200-claim test set to 1,000+ claims.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Expanding beyond English-only analysis.
- **Plugin System**: Allowing developers to add custom evidence sources (e.g., Reddit, specialized academic databases).
